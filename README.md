## Overview
The code in this repository is for custom-built Chrome extension that overrides the "new tab" page and instead shows an html page displaying the current date & time, useful links, and a notepad that can be saved, meaning the notes persist even when the page is closed.


## How to use this extension
If you'd like to use this extension for yourself, or perhaps use parts of it and modify the rest, here's how you will need to set it up.

First, clone this repository. Then, open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`. Click the toggle in the upper-right corner marker "Developer Mode". You should then see three new buttons towards the top of your screen. Click "Load Unpacked", and then select the folder containing this repository. You can then turn off Developer Mode. Now, when you open up a new tab, you should see the customized page!

If you'd like to also make it so that Chrome opens up to this page, you can do that by navigating to `chrome://settings/defaultBrowser` and selecting "Open the New Tab page" in the "On Startup" section.
